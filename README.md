screenshot
==========

Behaves exactly like `import png:- | xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png`
when launched, except it doesn't break randomly with large screenshots.


installation
------------
`qmake && make && make install`

preferrably use a package manager, but maybe you like to live dangerously.
